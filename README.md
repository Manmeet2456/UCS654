# Mashup Assignment (UCS654)

This project is made as part of **UCS654** assignment.
Goal of this project is to create a mashup generator using python. It has two parts — one command line program and one small web app using Flask.

## 📌 What this project does

Basically user gives:

* Singer Name
* Number of videos
* Duration (seconds)
* Email Id (for web version)

Program will:

1. Download videos from Youtube
2. Convert videos into audio files
3. Cut first *Y seconds* from each audio
4. Merge all parts into one mashup file
5. (Web version) send result as zip through email

## 💭 My Learning

While doing this assignment I learned:

* how to work with APIs and external libraries
* basic flask routing
* handling files and folders in python
* little bit about git and branches also 😅

Project is simple but it helped me understand how backend services work together.

Thanks 👍
